          exchanges on any food or beverage items</strong>, except where required
          by applicable law.

          If there is an issue with the quality of your order (such as receiving
          the wrong items or undercooked food), you must contact us within a
          reasonable time of receiving your order. We will review your complaint
          and, at our sole discretion, may offer a replacement or store credit.
          This does not constitute a general right to refunds.
